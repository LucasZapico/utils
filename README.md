# Utils 

Repo previously known as "macos-env-starter-script" 

## About 

A starter script that "all in one" installs and configures common programs such as Brew, Vscode, python, Node, etc. The goal of this script is to automate the environment setup when spinning up work environment on fresh macos install.

### TL:DR

**Why I started this project**

Over the years I have had to set up my development(work) environment on many computers and by the third time I knew I needed to automate as much of the process as I could. Thus `macos-env-starter-script` was born. As of 2022 the script is on iteration v1.5 and has finally made its way from personal gist to repo. 
At some point, I would like to have a curl install-like brew that just handles everything. But we'll see. 

### Some of what it does 

**Installs**
- brew
- oh-my-zsh 
- configures global github
- node
- python 
- vscode
- google chrome 
- dbngin 

## Feature Catch 

Catch for ideas for enhancement that are not slated features yet. 

### Ideas
- [ ] ?? vscode extensions ??

#### Features
- [x] add prompt to install all or prompt to install casks and packages 
- [ ] enhance error handling 

## Gotcha

### DBngin 

```sh 
# dbngin access bug fix
export PATH=/Users/Shared/DBngin/mysql/8.0.12/bin:$PATH
sudo chmod -R 777 /Users/Shared/DBngin/ 
```
### App from unverified developers

```sh 
sudo spctl --master-disable
```
